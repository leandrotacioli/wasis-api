# WASIS API

WASIS (Wildlife Animal Sound Identification System) is a public-domain software that recognizes animal species based on their sounds. From a partnership between Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS) and Fonoteca Neotropical Jacques Vielliard (FNJV) of the Institute of Biology of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), the main goal of this project is to design a tool which supports multiple algorithms to help scientists and general public on the identification of species.

This project is under development - the main goal of this API is to provide the same features (and additional ones) as those implemented in the original software.
